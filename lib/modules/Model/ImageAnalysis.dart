The fruits may begin to rot and eventually fall off. Symptoms of early blight occur on old foliage, stems, and fruits.  Grayish-brown spots appear on the foliage, and gradually grow concentrically around a clear center - forming the distinctive shooting target appearance.  These spots are surrounded by a bright yellow halo.  As the disease progresses, entire leaves may turn yellow due to chlorophyll deficiency and fall off, resulting in significant defoliation.  When the leaves die and fall, the fruits become more susceptible to sunburn.  The same type of spots with a clear center appears on the stems and fruits.
